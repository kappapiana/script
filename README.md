# Anonymize.sh not here any more

I have moved Anonymize to a separate repository. Please navigate to <https://github.com/kappapiana/anonymize> to find it again.

# What can you find here?

It's just a collection of random scripts, some can be useful, some are not.


`v4l2wrapper.sh` could be useful: it allows interacting with your camera and exploring the settings you can change. Very useful if you know a bit of digital imaging, improvements could be substantial. A wrapper to v4l2 (Video for Linux 2), a set of libraries to manage webcams.

## Future

Some of these scripts may one day have a life of their own. Others are just quick & dirty stuff I need without much care as to how they are made. The ones mentioned above have received some more attention and are good candidates to go around.

## Environment

Everything is based on `bash` and targets `Debian` and Debian derivates, chiefly, `Ubuntu`.
